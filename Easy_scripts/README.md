# Simple Python Scripts #

This directory on the repository contains a collection of simple Python scripts for various tasks.

## Scripts ##

**Tip Calculator:** This script takes the total of a restaurant bill and automatically calculates the tip amount, allowing the user to specify the desired tip percentage.

**To-Do List:** This program allows the user to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It is implemented using a Python list to store the tasks.

**Password Generator:** This script generates secure passwords randomly. The user can specify the length and types of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, etc.) they want to include in the password.

**Hangman Game:** This script implements the classic hangman game in Python. The program chooses a word at random from a predefined list and allows the user to guess letters until they guess the whole word or run out of attempts.

**Mini File Management System:** This script allows the user to perform basic file management operations, such as creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and directories. It uses the "os" library in Python to interact with the file system.

## Usage ##

Each script can be run from the command line using the following command:

```python script_name.py```

For the To-Do List and Mini File Management System scripts, you will be presented with a menu of options. Enter the number of the option you want to select, and then follow the prompts.
