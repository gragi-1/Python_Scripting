# Advanced Python Projects

This folder contains a series of advanced projects implemented in Python. Each project tackles complex challenges and requires advanced knowledge of Python programming, as well as familiarity with concepts such as machine learning, real-time data processing, and scalable architectures. Below is a description of each project:

## 1. Facial Recognition System

This project consists of a system capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images or videos. Libraries like OpenCV and dlib, along with deep learning algorithms, have been utilized to train facial recognition models.

## 2. Scalable E-commerce Platform

A complete e-commerce platform has been developed that can handle large volumes of traffic and transactions. This involves the development of user management systems, product management, payment processing, data analysis, etc. A framework like Django and scalability tools like AWS or Kubernetes were used.

## 3. Real-time Recommendation System

A real-time recommendation system has been created capable of analyzing user behavior on the website or application and offering personalized recommendations based on that information. This involves the use of technologies like Apache Kafka for streaming processing and real-time machine learning algorithms.

## 4. Social Media Sentiment Analysis Platform

This project involves developing a platform that can analyze large amounts of social media data (such as Twitter tweets) to extract trends and analyze user sentiment. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning are used for sentiment analysis.

## 5. Algorithmic Trading System

An automated trading system has been created that can execute trades in financial markets based on predefined algorithms and strategies. This involves integration with broker APIs, financial data analysis, risk modeling, and algorithmic trading algorithm development.
